            <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
            <p>
                The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
                The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. 
                For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
            </p>
            <h3>BMI Ranges</h3>
            <p>
                For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range.
                For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes
                into account age and gender as well as height and weight.
            </p>
            <h3>BMI in children</h3>
            <p>
                BMI is used differently for children. 
                It is calculated in the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same age. 
            </p>
            <h3>BMI Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.
                Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.
